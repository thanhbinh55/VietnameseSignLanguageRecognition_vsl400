# QIPEDC → VSL400 Metadata Conversion

Convert our 1000-word **QIPEDC** sign-language subset into the **VSL400** metadata format
(Zenodo DOI `10.5281/zenodo.17943574`). The output is a *superset* of VSL400: it keeps QIPEDC's own
fields (`region`, `topic`, `stt`, `id`), renames `LABEL` → `gloss`, keeps `video_id` from QIPEDC's
`VIDEO` (extension stripped), and adds the VSL400-derived fields (`signer_id`, `fps`, `resolution`,
`num_frames`, `length_seconds`).

Since QIPEDC has no signer data, `signer_id` is **extracted from video content** (OpenCV YuNet face
detection + SFace embeddings, threshold-based clustering) and clips are organized into per-signer
folders for manual verification.

```

Large media (`Dataset/raw_videos/`, `Dataset/processed_videos/`, `Dataset/by_signer/`),
downloaded models (`Dataset/models/`), the virtual environment (`.venv/`), and caches are
git-ignored. **Nothing is installed on `C:` — everything stays under the project on `D:`.**

## Setup (Windows / PowerShell)

Creates a project-local `.venv` on `D:`, redirects pip's cache to `D:`, and installs pinned deps:

```powershell
./setup_env.ps1
```

## End-to-end run (from scratch)

Follow these steps on a fresh machine to go from raw inputs all the way to the converted
metadata. Everything stays under the project folder on `D:` (no `C:` installs).

### 1. Get the QIPEDC data into place

The QIPEDC source data is **not** part of this repository (only the small label spreadsheet and the
final metadata are tracked). Put the inputs where the pipeline expects them:

```
Dataset/labels/<your-labels>.xlsx              # QIPEDC label files (one or more)
Dataset/processed_videos/resize_720p/*.mp4     # the clips (preferred 720p source)
Dataset/raw_videos/**/*.mp4                     # optional fallback source
```

- Label spreadsheets are read from `Dataset/labels/*.xlsx`. Each must have the header row
  `STT, ID, VIDEO, LABEL, REGION, TOPIC, signer` (matched case-insensitively); multiple files are
  combined automatically.
- Each row's `VIDEO` value (e.g. `D0530.mp4`) must resolve to a real file under
  `Dataset/processed_videos/resize_720p/` (searched first) or `Dataset/raw_videos/` (recursive
  fallback). Rows whose video is missing/unreadable are skipped and logged, not fatal.

> The VSL400 reference labels and the face-detection models are downloaded **automatically** by the
> run in step 3 — you do not fetch them by hand.

### 2. Create the environment

Creates a project-local `.venv` on `D:`, redirects pip's cache to `D:`, and installs pinned deps:

```powershell
./setup_env.ps1
```

### 3. Run the conversion

The package is run as a module. Since there is no editable install, add `src` to `PYTHONPATH` and
run from the project root using the venv interpreter:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m qipedc2vsl400.convert
```

This runs the full pipeline in order:

```
fetch → read → probe → extract-signers → map → write → organize-by-signer → verify
```

On the **first** run (without `--no-fetch`) it downloads:

- the VSL400 reference labels from Zenodo into `Dataset/labels/vsl400/`, and
- the YuNet + SFace ONNX face models from the OpenCV Zoo into `Dataset/models/` (on `D:`).

Signer extraction then runs face detection/embedding over every clip and clusters them, so the first
run takes a while (≈ several minutes for ~1000 clips). A non-zero exit code means verification
failed; check the run log.

Useful flags:

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--no-fetch` | Skip the Zenodo label + ONNX model download (use after the first run). |
| `--skip-signer` | Reuse an existing `signers.csv` instead of re-embedding every clip. |
| `--embeddings-cache` | Cache per-clip face embeddings and reuse them on re-runs, so only newly added clips are embedded (see *Adding new clips* below). |
| `--batch` | Batch/incremental mode using a persistent clip store, for video sets too large to hold on disk at once (see *Batch mode* below). |
| `--prune-missing` | With `--batch`, drop stored clips not in the current label rows (use only when the label file lists the full dataset). |
| `--stable-signers` | With `--batch`, keep `signer_id` stable across runs via a persistent signer registry (see *Stable signer ids* below). |
| `--recluster` | With `--batch --stable-signers`, re-cluster the whole store and re-seed the registry (numbers may change). |
| `--on-missing-video {skip,placeholder}` | Policy when a referenced video is missing/unreadable (default: `skip`). |
| `--copy-mode {hardlink,copy}` | How clips are placed into per-signer folders (default: `hardlink`). |
| `--signer-threshold <float>` | Cosine "same-signer" distance threshold for clustering (default `0.363`). |
| `--project-root <path>` | Override the project root (defaults to the repository root). |

A fast re-run that reuses the previous signer extraction and skips downloads:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m qipedc2vsl400.convert --no-fetch --skip-signer
```

### Adding new clips later (incremental embedding cache)

When you add more videos (with matching rows in the label spreadsheet) and re-run, signer
extraction normally re-embeds **every** clip — the costly step. Pass `--embeddings-cache` to keep a
cache of per-clip face embeddings (`Dataset/processed_videos/metadata/embeddings.npz`, git-ignored) so
only the **new** clips are embedded; the cached vectors are reused for everything seen before:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
# first run: builds the cache while converting
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m qipedc2vsl400.convert --embeddings-cache
# after adding new clips + their label rows: only new clips get embedded
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m qipedc2vsl400.convert --no-fetch --embeddings-cache
```

The cache is purely a speed optimization: clustering still runs over **all** clips (cached + new),
so the result is identical to a full re-run. New clips of an existing person join that person's
cluster (same `signer_id`); new people get new clusters. Within any single run, all clips of one
person always share one `signer_id`. (Note: the numeric label assigned to a given person — e.g.
`signer_001` — may differ between runs, since clusters are numbered by their smallest `VIDEO`
filename; within one output it is always consistent.)

> Do **not** combine `--embeddings-cache` with `--skip-signer`: `--skip-signer` bypasses extraction
> entirely (reusing `signers.csv`), so new clips would all fall into the `unknown` bucket.

### Batch mode for very large video sets (`--batch`)

If the full video set is too large to keep on disk at once, process it in batches: add a batch's
videos, run, delete them, then bring in the next batch. `--batch` accumulates everything needed to
emit and cluster each clip into a persistent **clip store** (`Dataset/processed_videos/metadata/clip_store.json`
+ `clip_store_embeddings.npz`, both git-ignored), so the output always covers **all** clips ever
processed — even ones whose video files have since been deleted.

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
# Batch 1: put batch-1 videos + their label rows in place, then:
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m qipedc2vsl400.convert --batch
# delete batch-1 videos, add batch-2 videos + label rows, then:
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m qipedc2vsl400.convert --batch
# ...repeat for each batch
```

How it behaves each run:

- A clip already in the store is kept as-is (its video need not be present).
- A clip new to the store is probed + embedded from its on-disk video and added to the store.
- A clip in the labels but with no on-disk video and not yet in the store is skipped-and-logged.

Clustering runs over **all** stored embeddings (old + new), so a new clip of a previously-seen
person joins that person's cluster and shares its `signer_id` — even if that person's earlier videos
were deleted. (`signer_id` numbers may still be relabeled between runs, as noted above.)

Notes / limits:

- `--batch` assumes the ONNX face models are already downloaded (run once normally, or with
  `--embeddings-cache`, first). It does not fetch.
- `Dataset/by_signer/` can only contain clips whose videos are currently on disk; clips deleted in
  earlier batches won't appear there for manual review (their metadata is still emitted).
- `--prune-missing` (with `--batch`) drops stored clips whose `video_id` is not in the **current**
  label rows. Use it only when the label file lists the full intended dataset; otherwise it would
  drop earlier batches.

### Stable signer ids across runs (`--stable-signers`)

By default the `signer_id` *number* assigned to a given person can change between runs (clusters are
renumbered by their smallest `VIDEO`). To keep a person's number fixed forever, add
`--stable-signers` (with `--batch`). It maintains a persistent **signer registry**
(`Dataset/processed_videos/metadata/signer_registry.json`, git-ignored) holding one representative embedding
(centroid) per signer:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m qipedc2vsl400.convert --batch --stable-signers
```

Each run, every clip is matched to the nearest registered signer centroid: within
`--signer-threshold` → it keeps that existing `signer_id` (and updates the centroid); otherwise a new
number is appended. So a new clip of a previously-seen person always lands on that person's existing
number — even if their earlier videos were deleted — and existing numbers never change.

How clustering compares people: each clip is reduced to a 128-D **face embedding** (OpenCV SFace);
two clips are "the same signer" when their embeddings are close in **cosine distance**. These
embeddings are exactly what the clip store / registry persist.

Trade-offs:

- Assignment is order-dependent (online), not a global optimum.
- It never *merges* two already-registered signer ids even if later evidence shows they are the same
  person. Run `--recluster` (with `--batch --stable-signers`) to re-cluster the whole store globally
  and re-seed the registry when you want to fix that (numbers may change on that run).

### 4. Outputs

```
Dataset/processed_videos/metadata/front_view.json   # the converted metadata (JSON array, sorted by video_id)
Dataset/processed_videos/metadata/signers.csv       # per-clip signer assignment side-car
Dataset/by_signer/signer_XXX/                       # clips grouped per extracted signer (+ signer_unknown/)
Dataset/by_signer/_summary.txt                      # clip counts per signer
Dataset/logs/convert_<timestamp>.log                # full run log
```

Open each `Dataset/by_signer/signer_XXX/` folder to manually verify that the extracted signers look
correct. If a real signer was split into two folders (or two signers merged into one), re-run with a
tuned `--signer-threshold` (raise it to merge more, lower it to split more).

## Multi-variant video splitting (`qipedc_video_preprocess`)

Some QIPEDC clips pack **2–3 sign variants ("cách")** of the *same* gloss into one `.mp4`. A small
number in the **top-left corner** ("CÁCH 1", "CÁCH 2", …) marks each variant. Extracting keypoints
from such a clip would mix several variants into one training sample. The independent preprocessing
stage in `src/qipedc_video_preprocess/` detects that number via OCR, splits multi-variant clips into
one sub-clip per variant, and writes a reconciled label spreadsheet — without touching the
`qipedc2vsl400` pipeline or the source labels.

It is fully separate from the metadata conversion above: its own package, its own config, its own
outputs under `Dataset/processed_videos/`.

In addition to multi-variant ("cách") splitting, the stage also detects **multi-view** clips that
pack a front and a side camera angle into one file and splits them into a front clip (`<id>.mp4`) and
a side clip (`<id>_side.mp4`). The cut point is chosen by an **ensemble**: OCR/hard-cut proposes the
boundary and a pose signal (the hands lowering between angles) confirms it. Confident cuts go to
`split_variants/`; cuts agreed only loosely go to `split_variant_predicted/` for a quick review.

### How it works

```
validate config (must be on D:) → discover *.mp4 → per video:
  sample frames (~1/s) → OCR wide ROI (top-left 40%×25%) for "CÁCH" token → classify
    no "CÁCH" token            → single variant (kept as-is, original name)
    "CÁCH" + stable 1→2→…→N   → multi (confirmed)  → cut into <id>_c1.mp4 … <id>_cN.mp4
    "CÁCH" + inferred boundary → multi (inferred)   → cut + copy to split_variant_predicted/
    "CÁCH" + no boundary found → manual              → copy original to manual/
→ write Dataset/processed_videos/labels_split.xlsx → log run + RunReport
```

**Detection strategy** — three passes per frame over a wide ROI:

1. **Pass 1 — full token**: OCR reads the whole "CÁCH N" text (handles variants like `"Cach"`,
   `"Bach"`, `"'SacH 2'"`, `"P█GH 1"` caused by the logo partially covering the overlay).
2. **Pass 2 — fragment + nearby digit**: when only a fragment of "CÁCH" is visible (e.g. `"ca"`,
   `"ch"`, `"á"`), look for a digit token nearby to the right.
3. **Glyph-width fallback** (`_zoom_digit_right_of`): when the logo covers the digit itself,
   zoom into the area right of "CÁCH" and use both OCR and a pixel-column-width ratio
   (`glyph_width_ratio`) to distinguish "1" (narrow) from "2" (wider), cross-checking both signals.

A boundary between variants requires `boundary_confirm_frames` (default 2) consecutive samples with
the new digit before it is accepted. A safety margin of frames is dropped around each internal
boundary so no transition frame leaks between sub-clips. Sub-clips keep the source `fps` and
resolution exactly. Re-running on the same inputs is idempotent.

### Run it (manual, from the project root)

The stage runs as a module. Add `src` to `PYTHONPATH` and use the venv interpreter:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m qipedc_video_preprocess.preprocess
```

By default it scans `Dataset/processed_videos/resize_720p/` (preferred) then `Dataset/raw_videos/`,
reads source labels from `Dataset/labels/*.xlsx`, and writes clips to
`Dataset/processed_videos/split_variants/` and the label file to
`Dataset/processed_videos/labels_split.xlsx`. On the **first** run EasyOCR downloads its detection +
recognition weights (~64 MB) into `Dataset/models/easyocr/` (on `D:`, never on `C:`).

CLI flags:

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--project-root <path>` | Override the project root (defaults to the current directory). |
| `--sample-interval <sec>` | Frame sampling interval, `0.1`–`5.0` (default `1.0`). |
| `--safety-margin <frames>` | Frames trimmed each side of an internal boundary, `0`–`60` (default `3`). |
| `--ocr-threshold <float>` | Minimum OCR confidence to accept a digit, `0.0`–`1.0` (default `0.5`). |
| `--dry-run` | Discover + classify only; do not write clips or labels. |

### Outputs

```
Dataset/processed_videos/split_variants/<id>.mp4       # single-variant clips (kept as-is)
Dataset/processed_videos/split_variants/<id>_c1.mp4 …  # one sub-clip per variant (confirmed multi)
Dataset/processed_videos/labels_split.xlsx             # reconciled labels (STT renumbered 1..M)
Dataset/processed_videos/split_variant_predicted/<id>_cN.mp4   # sub-clips cut by inference (check boundaries)
Dataset/processed_videos/split_variant_predicted/<id>.mp4      # original alongside, for comparison
Dataset/processed_videos/manual/<id>.mp4               # original of clips that need manual cutting
Dataset/processed_videos/manual/review_clips/<id>/     # pre-cut preview clips for review
Dataset/logs/preprocess_<timestamp>.log                # run log + RunReport summary
```

The three output categories:

| Category | Meaning | Action needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `split_variants/` | OCR confirmed boundary (≥2 stable frames per variant) | None — ready to use |
| `split_variant_predicted/` | Boundary inferred from stable blocks; OCR did not read full sequence | Review cut point |
| `manual/` | "CÁCH" overlay seen but boundary could not be determined | Cut manually |

### Calibrating the OCR ROI (important)

The "CÁCH" number sits **just right of the QIPEDC logo** in the top-left corner. The ROI that
isolates it is config-driven (`roi_top_left`, proportional `0.0`–`1.0` coordinates). The default
`(0.19, 0.05, 0.25, 0.22)` was calibrated on 1280×720 clips: it skips the logo and the "H" of
"CÁCH" so the OCR reads a clean single digit. A ROI that is too wide (covering the logo) makes
EasyOCR read noise (e.g. two-digit strings), which the detector rejects, so **every clip would be
misclassified as single-variant**. If your clips have a different layout, dump a couple of frames,
inspect the top-left corner, and adjust `roi_top_left` in `src/qipedc_video_preprocess/config.py`
(or build a `PreprocessConfig` with an overridden ROI in a small runner script).

## Manual cutting (`manual_cut`)

For clips the OCR detector cannot handle (the ones it copies into `manual/`), or whenever you already
know the exact cut times, cut them by hand from a table instead of OCR. You supply the cut points in a
CSV/XLSX and the tool writes clips with the same naming convention as the auto splitter (`_c1/_c2/…`
for variants, `_side` for the second camera).

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m qipedc_video_preprocess.manual_cut `
    --input src\qipedc_video_preprocess\manual_cuts.example.csv --dry-run
# bỏ --dry-run để ghi clip thật vào split_variants/
```

Table schema (header case-insensitive; see `src/qipedc_video_preprocess/manual_cuts.example.csv`):

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `video_id` | source video stem, e.g. `W00738` |
| `mode` | `multiway` (variants) \| `multiview` (front/side) \| `both` |
| `cut_seconds` | start second(s) of variant 2,3,… — e.g. `2.5` or `2.5,5.0` (for `multiway`/`both`) |
| `view_cut_seconds` | front→side hard-cut second(s). `multiview`: one value; `both`: one per variant |
| `notes` | free text (optional) |

Cuts use the **exact** seconds you give (no safety-margin trim, no inference) and are written to
`split_variants/` as reviewer-confirmed output.

## Stage B: keypoints (`keypoint/`), and publishing the dataset

The keypoint stage is bundled in this repo so the full pipeline runs from one checkout. See
`HUONG_DAN_FULL_PIPELINE.md` for the end-to-end manual run.

- **Keypoint extraction + preprocessing + training** (MediaPipe Holistic `.pose` → normalized `.npy`
  → SPOTER / SL-GCN) lives under `keypoint/src/` (`extract_keypoints.py` → `preprocess_dataset.py`
  → `train.py`). This code is **CC BY 4.0** from the upstream
  [VietnameseSignLanguageRecognition](https://github.com/thanhbinh55/VietnameseSignLanguageRecognition)
  project; attribution is kept in `keypoint/LICENSE` and `keypoint/CITATION.cff`. Its dependencies are
  included in `requirements.txt` (the "GIAI ĐOẠN B" block).
- **Publishing as a keypoint dataset.** `scripts/sync_public_dataset.py` maps this repo's output
  (`metadata/front_view.json` + `side_view.json`) into the published dataset layout
  (`cam_front.json` / `cam_side.json`, `labels.csv`, `gloss.csv`, `split_info.csv`), routing `_side`
  clips to the side camera. `labels.csv`/`gloss.csv` use a deterministic `gloss_id` (the gloss's index
  in the sorted unique-gloss list); `split_info.csv` is a deterministic train/val/test split grouped
  by source video so a clip's variants/views never straddle splits.

  ```powershell
  python scripts/sync_public_dataset.py --project-root . --public-root "<published-dataset-dir>" --dry-run
  ```

## Test

```powershell
python -m pytest
```

## Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for pinned dependencies (`openpyxl`, `opencv-python-headless`, `numpy`,
`scikit-learn`, `easyocr`, `requests`, `pytest`, `hypothesis`).

---

## Hướng dẫn theo từng trường hợp (Tiếng Việt)

Tất cả lệnh chạy **từ thư mục gốc của project** bằng trình Python trong `.venv`. Mở PowerShell,
`cd` vào thư mục project, rồi mỗi phiên làm việc đặt biến môi trường một lần:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
```

> Vì package nằm trong `src\` và không cài editable, cần `$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"` trước khi chạy
> `-m qipedc2vsl400.convert`. Có thể dùng trực tiếp `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe` mà không cần
> "activate" venv.

### Cơ chế phân cụm signer (để hiểu các mode bên dưới)

Mỗi clip được rút thành một **vector embedding khuôn mặt 128 chiều** (OpenCV YuNet phát hiện mặt →
SFace sinh embedding → trung bình, chuẩn hóa L2). Hai clip được coi là **cùng một người** khi hai
vector gần nhau theo **cosine distance** (ngưỡng `--signer-threshold`, mặc định `0.363`). Các vector
này là thứ được lưu lại trong cache / clip store / registry.

Lưu ý chung về đánh số: trong **một lần chạy**, mọi clip của một người luôn cùng một `signer_id`.
Nhưng **con số** `signer_001/002/...` có thể đổi nhãn giữa các lần chạy (trừ khi dùng
`--stable-signers`).

---

### Trường hợp 1 — Chạy lần đầu từ đầu (máy mới)

1. Đặt dữ liệu đúng chỗ:
   - Label QIPEDC: `Dataset\labels\*.xlsx` (header: `STT, ID, VIDEO, LABEL, REGION, TOPIC, signer`).
   - Video: `Dataset\processed_videos\resize_720p\*.mp4` (và/hoặc `Dataset\raw_videos\`).
2. Tạo môi trường venv trên D::
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\setup_env.ps1
   ```
3. Chạy chuyển đổi (lần đầu tự tải VSL400 labels + model khuôn mặt):
   ```powershell
   $env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
   .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m qipedc2vsl400.convert
   ```
4. Kết quả: `Dataset\processed_videos\metadata\front_view.json`, `signers.csv`, `Dataset\by_signer\...`,
   log trong `Dataset\logs\`. Mã thoát `0` nghĩa là verify đạt (`echo $LASTEXITCODE`).

### Trường hợp 2 — Đã chạy 1 lần, thêm video mới (KHÔNG xóa video cũ)

Vẫn giữ toàn bộ video cũ trên đĩa. Nhớ thêm **dòng label** cho video mới vào `*.xlsx`.

- Cách nhanh (chỉ embed clip mới, dùng lại embedding cũ qua cache):
  ```powershell
  $env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
  # lần đầu bật cache để dựng cache:
  .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m qipedc2vsl400.convert --embeddings-cache
  # sau khi thêm video mới + dòng label, chỉ clip mới được embed:
  .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m qipedc2vsl400.convert --no-fetch --embeddings-cache
  ```
- `--no-fetch`: bỏ tải mạng (model + VSL400 labels đã có).
- **Không** dùng `--skip-signer` ở đây (nó bỏ qua trích xuất, clip mới sẽ rơi vào `unknown`).
- Kết quả: phân cụm lại trên toàn bộ (cũ + mới) → đúng; clip mới trùng người với clip cũ vào chung
  cụm. Số `signer_id` có thể đổi nhãn so với lần trước.

### Trường hợp 3 — Video quá nặng, chạy theo từng đợt (xóa cũ, thêm mới)

Dùng chế độ batch: clip store tích lũy nên metadata cuối luôn đủ cả các đợt, kể cả video đã xóa.

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
# Đợt 1: bỏ video đợt 1 + dòng label tương ứng, rồi:
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m qipedc2vsl400.convert --batch
# Xóa video đợt 1, bỏ video đợt 2 + dòng label, rồi:
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m qipedc2vsl400.convert --batch
# ... lặp lại cho từng đợt
```

- `--batch` giả định **model đã tải sẵn** (chạy Trường hợp 1 một lần trước, hoặc đã có
  `Dataset\models\`). Nó không tự fetch.
- Phân cụm chạy trên **toàn bộ kho** (cũ + mới) → clip mới trùng người với clip cũ (đã xóa video)
  vẫn vào **chung cụm**, và metadata vẫn xuất đủ clip cũ.
- `Dataset\by_signer\` chỉ chứa được video còn trên đĩa; clip của đợt đã xóa sẽ không có thư mục để
  xem lại (nhưng metadata vẫn đủ).

### Trường hợp 4 — Muốn `signer_id` CỐ ĐỊNH giữa các lần chạy

Thêm `--stable-signers` (kết hợp `--batch`). Một người được khớp với signer cũ sẽ **giữ nguyên số**;
người mới mới được cấp số mới; số cũ không bao giờ đổi.

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m qipedc2vsl400.convert --batch --stable-signers
# các đợt sau cũng thêm --stable-signers
```

- Khi muốn gom lại tối ưu toàn cục + đánh số lại (vd để gộp hai signer thật ra là một người):
  ```powershell
  .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m qipedc2vsl400.convert --batch --stable-signers --recluster
  ```
- Lưu ý: chế độ ổn định gán "trực tuyến" (phụ thuộc thứ tự) và **không tự gộp** hai `signer_id` đã
  đăng ký — dùng `--recluster` khi cần gộp/đặt lại số.

### Trường hợp 5 — Chạy lại nhanh trên dữ liệu không đổi

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m qipedc2vsl400.convert --no-fetch --skip-signer
```
`--skip-signer` dùng lại `signers.csv` đã có (không nhúng lại). Chỉ dùng khi **không** thêm clip mới.

### Trường hợp 6 — Đổi đường dẫn video / output / thư mục signer

Các đường dẫn nằm trong `Config` (`src\qipedc2vsl400\config.py`). CLI chỉ cho đổi vài thứ qua flag,
nên đổi đường dẫn thì:

- **Cách A** — sửa giá trị mặc định trong `config.py`. Các field hay đổi: `video_search_dirs`
  (nơi tìm video), `foldering_source` (nguồn gom signer), `by_signer_dir`, `output_dir`,
  `output_view_name`, `qipedc_labels_glob`, `models_dir`. Đường dẫn có thể tương đối (ghép vào
  `project_root`) hoặc tuyệt đối.
- **Cách B** — viết script ghi đè bằng `dataclasses.replace` mà không sửa code gốc:
  ```python
  from pathlib import Path
  import dataclasses
  from qipedc2vsl400.config import Config
  from qipedc2vsl400.convert import run_pipeline

  cfg = Config(project_root=Path.cwd())
  cfg = dataclasses.replace(
      cfg,
      video_search_dirs=("E:/my_videos",),
      foldering_source="E:/my_videos",
      output_dir="E:/output/metadata",
  )
  raise SystemExit(run_pipeline(cfg, fetch=False).exit_code)
  ```

### Trường hợp 7 — Xóa bớt clip khỏi dataset

- Khi muốn loại một clip: xóa **cả dòng label** của nó (và file video). Chỉ xóa file video mà giữ
  dòng label sẽ khiến clip bị skip-and-log (chế độ thường) hoặc bị kéo vào cụm "ma" nếu còn trong
  cache/kho.
- Chế độ batch: dùng `--prune-missing` (với `--batch`) để bỏ khỏi kho các clip **không** có trong
  dòng label hiện tại — chỉ dùng khi file label đang liệt kê **toàn bộ** dataset mong muốn (nếu
  không sẽ xóa nhầm các đợt cũ).

### Bảng chọn nhanh

| Tình huống | Lệnh |
| --- | --- |
| Lần đầu từ đầu | `... convert` |
| Thêm video mới (giữ video cũ) | `... convert --no-fetch --embeddings-cache` |
| Chạy lại nhanh, dữ liệu không đổi | `... convert --no-fetch --skip-signer` |
| Chạy theo đợt (xóa cũ thêm mới) | `... convert --batch` |
| Chạy theo đợt + giữ cố định số signer | `... convert --batch --stable-signers` |
| Gom lại + đánh số lại (chế độ ổn định) | `... convert --batch --stable-signers --recluster` |

(`...` = `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m qipedc2vsl400`, sau khi đã `$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"`.)

### Kiểm tra kết quả nhanh

```powershell
echo $LASTEXITCODE                                    # 0 = verify đạt
Get-Content Dataset\by_signer\_summary.txt
Get-ChildItem Dataset\processed_videos\metadata\
```

## Tách video nhiều cách (Tiếng Việt) — `qipedc_video_preprocess`

Một số video QIPEDC gộp **2–3 cách biểu diễn** của **cùng một từ** vào một file. Con số ở **góc trên
bên trái** ("CÁCH 1", "CÁCH 2", …) đánh dấu từng cách. Công đoạn này tự phát hiện con số bằng OCR,
cắt video nhiều cách thành nhiều video con (mỗi cách một file), và xuất bảng nhãn mới — **không** đụng
pipeline `qipedc2vsl400` và **không** ghi đè bảng nhãn nguồn.

### Cơ chế phát hiện (Tiếng Việt)

Pipeline lấy mẫu ~1 frame/giây và chạy 2 lượt OCR trên vùng ROI rộng (40%×25% góc trên trái):

1. **Lượt 1 — token đầy đủ**: tìm token khớp với "CÁCH" (bao gồm các biến thể OCR do logo che: `"Cach"`, `"Bach"`, `"'SacH 2'"`, `"P█GH 1"`…). Nếu thấy → đọc số kèm theo hoặc token số gần nhất bên phải.
2. **Lượt 2 — mảnh + số lân cận**: khi chỉ thấy một phần nhỏ (`"ca"`, `"ch"`, `"á"`…), tìm token số gần đó trong ROI.
3. **Fallback glyph-width**: khi logo che cả con số, phóng to vùng bên phải "CÁCH" và đo tỉ lệ chiều rộng pixel của glyph — số "1" hẹp (~0.33), số "2" rộng hơn (~0.37) — kết hợp với OCR để quyết định.

Ranh giới giữa các cách cần `boundary_confirm_frames` (mặc định 2) frame mẫu liên tiếp cùng giá trị số mới mới được chấp nhận.

### Chạy (thủ công, từ thư mục gốc project)

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m qipedc_video_preprocess.preprocess
```

Mặc định: duyệt `Dataset\processed_videos\resize_720p\` (ưu tiên) rồi `Dataset\raw_videos\`, đọc nhãn
từ `Dataset\labels\*.xlsx`, ghi clip ra `Dataset\processed_videos\split_variants\` và bảng nhãn ra
`Dataset\processed_videos\labels_split.xlsx`. Lần đầu EasyOCR tự tải trọng số (~64 MB) về
`Dataset\models\easyocr\` (trên `D:`, không lên `C:`).

| Flag | Ý nghĩa |
| --- | --- |
| `--project-root <path>` | Đổi thư mục gốc (mặc định: thư mục hiện tại). |
| `--sample-interval <giây>` | Khoảng lấy mẫu frame, `0.1`–`5.0` (mặc định `1.0`). |
| `--safety-margin <frame>` | Số frame bỏ mỗi phía ranh giới, `0`–`60` (mặc định `3`). |
| `--ocr-threshold <float>` | Ngưỡng tin cậy OCR tối thiểu, `0.0`–`1.0` (mặc định `0.5`). |
| `--dry-run` | Chỉ duyệt + phân loại, không ghi clip/nhãn. |

### Kết quả

```
Dataset\processed_videos\split_variants\<id>.mp4       # video một cách (giữ nguyên tên)
Dataset\processed_videos\split_variants\<id>_c1.mp4 …  # mỗi cách một video con (multi xác nhận)
Dataset\processed_videos\labels_split.xlsx             # bảng nhãn mới (STT đánh lại 1..M)
Dataset\processed_videos\split_variant_predicted\<id>_cN.mp4   # clip đã cắt bằng suy luận (cần kiểm ranh giới)
Dataset\processed_videos\split_variant_predicted\<id>.mp4      # bản gốc đặt cạnh để so sánh
Dataset\processed_videos\manual\<id>.mp4               # bản gốc video cần cắt thủ công
Dataset\logs\preprocess_<timestamp>.log                # log + RunReport
```

Ba nhóm kết quả:

| Nhóm | Ý nghĩa | Việc cần làm |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `split_variants/` | OCR xác nhận ranh giới (≥2 frame ổn định mỗi cách) | Không cần — dùng ngay |
| `split_variant_predicted/` | Ranh giới suy luận từ khối ổn định; OCR không đọc trọn dãy số | Kiểm tra điểm cắt |
| `manual/` | Có nhãn "CÁCH" nhưng không xác định được ranh giới | Cắt tay |

### Hiệu chỉnh ROI con số (quan trọng)

Con số "CÁCH" nằm **ngay bên phải logo QIPEDC** ở góc trên trái. ROI hẹp để OCR đọc số (`roi_top_left`,
tọa độ tỉ lệ `0.0`–`1.0`) mặc định `(0.19, 0.05, 0.25, 0.22)` — hiệu chỉnh thực nghiệm trên video
1280×720: cô lập đúng con số, bỏ logo và chữ "H" của "CÁCH". ROI quá rộng (ôm cả logo) khiến OCR đọc
nhiễu (chuỗi 2 chữ số) → bị loại → **mọi video bị phân loại nhầm thành một cách**. Nếu bố cục video
khác, dump vài frame, xem góc trên trái, rồi chỉnh `roi_top_left` trong
`src\qipedc_video_preprocess\config.py`.
